This is going to be a less wordy blog, and more of a showcase of where I came from along with links. I think you'll notice a trend of anime content haha.

### First Projects

I got into Web Development by making **_"Start pages"_**, (pages that load up when you start the browser).

Give it a refresh, I made multiple themes but this was the first project I as "proud" of.

But I made ... a lot of these pages as I was learning.

### Turning Point

I really fell in love with Web Development when I made my first big project, which I got help from real developers.

I loved the project so much, I made another version as I learned about Vue

Although they may be embarassing to show off, it's always good to know where you came from. However these projects only scratch the surface of the mini-projects I've done. It would take me hours to post all of them.
If you're learning, build whatever you want, you'll get better, and you'll stay more motivated that way, instead of building to-do apps and tutorials.
