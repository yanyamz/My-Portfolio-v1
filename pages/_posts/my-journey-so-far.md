I began programming in University (2016), learning C++ and other low level languages and concepts. I enjoyed it, but the university enviornment, along with the lack of creativity in anything we did was really demotivating. After I left Uni, I discovered my love for Web Development! It was a way to be creative, along with dealing with the logic of programming I grew to enjoy. Since then, I knew I wanted to become a Web Devloper. It's been a tough journey through peaks and valleys of motivation. But I realized through a series of deadend jobs that if I don't take this seriously, I would never reach my goals, so here I am!
